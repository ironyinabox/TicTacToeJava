# TicTacToeJava
This is my Tic Tac Toe in Java.
What is particularly fun about this version of tictactoe is that it can accomodate multiple board sizes! 
I figured it'd be a little to easy to just do a 3x3 board size.
Once you've set a board size, you'll have to stop and run it again to change the board size.
